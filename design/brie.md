# Brie

Brie is a language built to be *easy*, *fun*, and ridiculously *powerful*.

## Language Goals

*Inferred types* - Brie infers all the types at compile time, so you will never get a runtime type error. Plus there are no type signatures.

*Structural types* - "If it looks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it is a duck."
Functions only care if their arguments have the right properties, not what they are.

*Macros* - Brie's syntax is not lisp - but it is simple. Since the compiler is written in Brie, Brie code can easily manipulate its own syntax tree at compile-time.


*Brie bridges the gap between static and dynamic languages, with minimal, generic, and safe code.*
