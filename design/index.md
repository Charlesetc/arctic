Arctic is the kind of programming language you occasionally glimpse standing in the shadows; the eyes of an owl, large, round, and blue, stare back, unblinking, from the darkness. Not everyone wanders this far off the path of sanity: those who do, beware. For Arctic is forged only by those strong of will and kind of heart.

Or not! Arctic's for everyone. 👻 Welcome

Arctic is a small, easy, and fast language. The goal is to create a statically typed, compiled language, that feels as dynamic as ruby or lisp. It does this with **inferred structural types**. Think implicit duck-typing, and checked at compile-time.
