Artic is the kind of programming language you occasionally glimpse standing in the shadows; the eyes of an owl, large, round, and blue, stare back, unblinking, from the darkness. Not everyone wanders this far off the path of sanity: those who do, beware. For Artic is forged only by those strong of will and kind of heart.

Or not! Artic's for everyone. ðŸ‘» Welcome

Artic is a small, easy, and fast language. The goal is to create a statically typed, compiled language, that feels as dynamic as ruby or lisp. It does this with **inferred structural types**. Think implicit duck-typing, checked at compile-time.
