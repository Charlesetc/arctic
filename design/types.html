<h1 id="brie-types"><a href="/">Brie</a> <em>[ types ]</em></h1>
<p>Brie's type system has <em>structural typing</em>, also known as row polymorphism.</p>
<p>This means that Brie cares about what an object or value <em>can do</em>, not what it's exact type is.</p>
<p>Brie does not have type signatures, and may look like a dynamic language, but <em>all type errors appear at compile time</em>.</p>
<p>So what can you do in Brie?</p>
<pre><code>define square : x [
  x * x
]
square 3
square 5.0</code></pre>
<p>This works! Even though <code>3</code> is an integer and <code>5.0</code> is a float, they both have a <code>.*</code> method. Similarly,</p>
<pre><code>let square = &lt;sides = 4, color = &quot;blue&quot;&gt;
let triangle = &lt;sides = 3, color = &quot;red&quot;&gt;

define print_sides : object [ print object.sides ]

print_sides square  -- prints &quot;4&quot;
print_sides triangle  -- prints &quot;3&quot;


-- Compile time error:
let lobster = &lt;color = &quot;red&quot;&gt;
print_sides lobster</code></pre>
<p>Furthermore, and this is the cool part, there is no more runtime cost to calling a method than there is to calling a function. This works because Brie only allows homogeneous lists.</p>
<pre><code>let a = [ 2 , 2.3 ]   -- this fails</code></pre>
<p>In order to get heterogeneous data, one must wrap each item in a polymorphic variant:</p>
<pre><code>let a = [
  Point &lt;x = 2, y = 3&gt;,
  Person &lt;name = &quot;bob&quot;&gt;,
  Number 3
]</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>Point</code>, <code>Person</code>, and <code>Number</code> are not defined anywhere. They are polymorphic variants that tell the compiler everything in a given expression with a given tag has the same type.</p>
<h2 id="other-languages">Other languages</h2>
<p>Is Brie's system replicated in any other languages?</p>
<p>Yes, several have structural typing, including OCaml, Go, and Scala.</p>
<p>Brie is the only one, however, with type inference and a standard library that takes advantage of its structural typing.</p>
<p>OCaml comes the closest, as it's also type-inferred and has structural types in objects. However, OCaml very rarely uses its object system and OCaml uses dynamic dispatch for method calls.</p>
