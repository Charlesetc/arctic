It could be cool if there was built-in support
for literate programming in brie. It would have
to give the right line numbers for the file,
which would be awesome and not that hard.

Actually I think this would be great.

Imagine requiring a file that ends in .lbrie,
and having the compiler transparently ignore.

I think this could mostly be done with macros,
after they exist and it's been bootstrapped.
