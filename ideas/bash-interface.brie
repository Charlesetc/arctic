-- If you could pipe to a bash function

require shell.sh

define uppercase : string [
  string.edit 0 : c [
    c.uppercase
  ]
]

define main : file [
  sh $ `cat file | lines uppercase | `jq '.this'
]

-- Okay so I really like this idea.
-- basically: ` is a prefix that
-- makes a "command" object.
-- then the `|` operator
-- makes a new command object
-- with the stdout being linked up, etc.
-- sh then just calls .run or something.
