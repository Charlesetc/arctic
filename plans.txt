# Planned Features

* classes
* stacktraces in type errors
* exceptions -- maybe not yet?

# Parsing

* support semicolons in blocks.
* parse floats correctly
* 'define' can take infinitely many args -- problem
* match statment

# Bugs

* `[]` don't get parsed on toplevel if they don't match
* `( x
    y )`
  - When there is a newline within parentheses,
    it stays around as the :newline token.
  - Do a grammar pass to get rid of them.
* Compiler 'require' doesn't handle directories at all.
  - also fix tests that use this.
* Found algorithm makes a mistake
  when passing in variables of the
  same name that were closed over.
