# Features

* module system

# Parsing

* add `let =` syntax
* if statements
* while statements
* support semicolons in blocks.
* parse floats correctly
* 'define' can take infinitely many args -- problem
* make a distinction in the tokenizer between operators and
  functions -- still just keep them as idents.

# Bugs

[] don't get parsed on toplevel if they don't match

# Roadmap

* Eventually compile to OCaml subset
