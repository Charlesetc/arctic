# Features

* module system
* polymorphic variants
* classes

# Parsing

* add `let =` syntax
* support semicolons in blocks.
* parse floats correctly
* 'define' can take infinitely many args -- problem
* make a distinction in the tokenizer between operators and
  functions -- still just keep them as idents.

# Bugs

* `[]` don't get parsed on toplevel if they don't match
* `( x
    y )`
  - When there is a newline within parentheses,
    it stays around as the :newline token.
  - Do a grammar pass to get rid of them.
* Compiler 'require' doesn't handle directories at all.
  - also fix tests that use this.
* Add varient types when it's just a single
  thing in an argument, not a function call.
